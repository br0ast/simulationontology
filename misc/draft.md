# Title: I have no fantasy

Comment: Do we want to have two separate papers for the "Framenet of Symbols" and the ontology that will be used to describe it? (How deeply do I have to describe the infrastructure of simulations that could be generated using the ontology).
One thing is to publish an ontology with examples.
Capacity to answer questions and a good coverage for the domain.

# Introduction

INTRODUCTION ON SYMBOLS ...

Compared to the highly debated topic of what symbols are and what can be considered a symbol or not, there is less discussion about the relationship that links the symbol to what it symbolizes.

<mark>The general introduction is very similar to the aiucd paper. There, for space reasons, I had to cut a lot, maybe I can look at it again</mark>

 --> introduce Baudrillard
BAUDRILLARD SIMULATION and SIMULACRA... <- In a transversal way



# State of the Art

WornNet -> meanings and synset do not include a symbolic/figurative meaning
MetaNet -> metaphors -> metaphorical meaning is somehow related to symbolic meaning, although it does not give a contextual meaning and the metaphors themselves are not context-depedent (a part from the linguistics one)

**AIUCD paper, here or in the introduction?**

Wikidata -> symbolizes is given to very specific contexts such as a single work of art. The pages for symbols are almost never linked to the reality counterparts that are symbolized. 

# Requirements for a Symbols Ontology

Be able to distinguish what kind of symbolic relationship lies between a simulacrum and the reality counterpart. The possibility to associate a socio-cultural context to a certain simulation. On an external use, having uris for simulations make it so that you can link multiple elements in which the simulation happens.

## Comparison of methodology

What would be better for the requirements: namegraphs, n-ary, blank nodes.


# Development

We can try to use XD. It's a very small ontology and it does not require modules.
