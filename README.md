# Simulation Ontology Development Documentation

This is the documentation of the development of the Simulation Ontology. The ontology purpose is to describe background symbolic knowledge about cultural Symbolism.

It was developed using SAMOD methodology [samod link].

The development stage was composed by three iterations:

1. Simulations and Symbols
2. Sources and Variants
3. Specialized Simulations

For every iteration, these documents are available:

* A motivating scenario along with concrete examples
* A series of informal CQs formulated for the scenario in natural language with the expected results
* An ABOX that contains the examples serialized in TURTLE.
* A series of formal CQs in SPARQL Language
* A jupyter file in which it is possible to query the ABOX and test the competency questions.
* A graphic representation of the ontology up to that iteration.

Finally, the ontology is available [here](index-en.html)
