## Name

Specialized Simulations

## Description

Simulations can be specialized according to the specific symbolic relationship that links a simulacrum with its reality counterpart. If something is the emblem of something else, or an allusion to something else, this specific relationship can be expressed through specialized simulations. In some specialized simulations, the reality counterpart might not be the exact symbolic meaning of a simulacrum. In some special cases, the reality counterpart might be something that is prevented, elicited, restored by the simulacrum in a symbolic way. Finally, some simulations might have a reality counterpart that represents the symbolic meaning of the simulacrum, and an additional one that represents something that is prevented, elicited, restored by the simulacrum.

According to `dictionaryOfSymbols1` an `acorn` is a symbolical protection against `plague` in a `generalOrUnknown` context. Therefore, the `acorn-plague` simulation is a `ProtectionSimulation` and `plague` is its prevented reality counterpart.

In the same dictionary, an `agate` is a `charm` for `healthyBlood` in an `arabian` context. Therefore, the resulting simulation is `agate-charm-healthyBlood` where `agate` is the simulacrum, `charm` is a reality counterpart and `healthyBlood` is an elicited reality counterpart.
In an `egyptian` context, `aloe` is a `charm` for `longevity`. As before, in the simulation is `aloe-charm-longevity` and `longevity` is the elicited reality counterpart.

In `literarySource1`, `amberStone`, in an `islamic` context is a symbolic cure for `jaundice`. Therefore, `amberStone-jaundice` is a `HealingSimulation` in which `jaundice` is the healed reality counterpart.

In the same source, `ashLeavesInWine`, in a `grecoRoman` context are a cure for `poison`. Therefore, `ashLeavesInWine-poison` is a `HealingSimulation` in which `poison` is the healed reality counterpart.

In `dictionaryOfSymbols2`, `acaciaThorns`, in an `egyptian` context, are the emblem of `neith`. Therefore, `acaciaThorns-neith` is an `EmblematicSimulation`.
Finally, in the same dictionary, a `bird` is the manifestation of `theGods` in `hindu` context. Therefore, `bird-theGods` is a `ManifestationSimulation`

In summary, there exist the following simulations:

* `acorn-plague`
* `agate-charm-healthyBlood`
* `aloe-charm-longevity`
* `amberStone-jaundice`
* `ashLeavesInWine-poison`
* `acaciaThorns-neith`
* `bird-theGods`

More specialized simulations can be found in the Glossary.
