## Question 2

### Identifier

CQ3.2

### General Question

What are the simulations that have a specific reality
counterpart and other additional reality counterparts, and what specific relationship link  those simulations to their reality counterparts?

### Example Applied Question

What are the simulations that have `charm` as a reality counterpart and other additional reality counterparts, and what specific relationship link  those simulations to their reality counterparts?

#### Expected Outcome

A table with simulations, reality counterparts, specific relationships.

#### Results

| Simulation               | Reality Counterpart | Specific Reality Counterpart Relationship Type |
|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `agate-charm-healthyBlood` | `healthyBlood`        | `elicitedRealityCounterpart`                    |
| `aloe-charm-longevity`     | `longevity`          | `elicitedRealityCounterpart`                     |

## Question 3

### Identifier

CQ3.3

### General Question

What are the simulations and their respective simulacra, contexts and reality counterparts in which their simulacrum is a symbolical cure for their reality counterpart?

### Example Applied Question

What are the simulations and their respective simulacra, contexts and reality counterparts in which their simulacrum is a symbolical cure for their reality counterpart?

#### Expected Outcome

A table with simulations, simulacra, contexts and healed reality counterparts.

#### Results

| simulation             | simulacrum      | context    | healed reality counterpart |
|------------------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|
| `amberStone-jaundice`    | `amberStone`      | `islamic`   | `jaundice`                 |
