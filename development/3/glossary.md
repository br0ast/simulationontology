|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Association Simulation        | A simulation in which the simulacrum is associated with the reality counterpart. It is a very general relationship and should be used only when the association is explicitly stated by the source. I.E. in a dictionary of symbols it is written that X "is associated with" Y.         |
| Correspondence Simulation     | A simulation in which the simulacrum corresponds to the reality counterpart. It is a very general relationship and should be used only when the correspondence is explicitly state by the source. I.E. in a dictionary of symbols it is written that X "corresponds to" Y.               |
| Manifestation Simulation      | A simulation in which the simulacrum is a manifestation of the reality counterpart. It is a very general relationship and should be used only when the manifestation is explicitly stated by the source. I.E. in a dictionary of symbols it is written than X "is a manifestation of" Y. |
| Relatedness Simulation        | A simulation in which the simulacrum is related to the reality counterpart. It is a very general relationship and should be used only when the relatedness is explicitly stated by the source. I.E. in a dictionary of symbols it is written that X "is related to" Y.                   |
| Attribute Simulation          | A specific kind of simulation in which the simulacrum is a symbolic attribute of the reality counterpart. Like "keys" as an attribute of Saint Peter.                                                                                                                                    |
| Allusion Simulation           | A specific kind of simulation in which the simulacrum alludes to the reality counterpart. Is a more subtle symbolic relationship than the normal simulation.                                                                                                                             |
| Protection Simulation         | A specific kind of simulation in which the simulacrum is a symbolic protection against the reality counterpart. Like agate as a protection against the evil eye.                                                                                                                         |
| Emblematic Simulation         | A specific kind of simulation in which the simulacrum is an emblem of the reality counterpart. Emblems are usually used as a graphical representation of something.                                                                                                                      |
| Healing Simulation            | A specific kind of simulation in which the simulacrum is a symbolic cure for the reality counterpart. The reality counterpart in this kind of simulation is in fact usually something negative like a disease or a curse.                                                                |
| Restored Reality Counterpart  | A specific relationship that links a simulation to a reality counterpart that is symbolically restored by the simulacrum.  Like the red valerian (simulacrum), which, in flower language, is symbolically believed to restore strenght (restored reality counterpart).                   |
| Eased Reality Counterpart     | A specific relationship that links a simulation to a reality counterpart that is symbolically eased by the simulacrum. Like the Onyx, which in Indic-Persian context is believed to symbolically ease childbirth.                                                                        |
| Elicited Reality Counterpart  | A specific relationship that links a simulation to a reality counterpart that is symbolically elicited by the simulacrum.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Prevented Reality Counterpart | A specific relationship that links a simulation (usually a Protection Simulation) to a reality counterpart that is symbolically prevented by the simulacrum.                                                                                                                             |
| Healed Reality Counterpart    | A specific relationship that links a simulation (usually a Healing Simulation) to a reality counterpart of which a simulacrum is the symbolic cure.                                                                                                                                      |
