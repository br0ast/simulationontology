# General Statement

Some of the classes expressed in this ontology (Simulation, Simulacrum, Reality Counterpart) are new to the domain of semantic web and there are no ontologies in which they are conceptualized.

## Prov-o alignment.

The property introduced in the iteration 2, hasSource, was replaced by an already existing property in the prov-o ontology: prov-o [wasDerivedFrom](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasDerivedFrom).
