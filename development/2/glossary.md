| Source  | A simulation is the symbolic relationship that happens between a symbol and its symbolic meaning. The term is taken from Baudrillard's "Simulation and Simulacra" philosophical theory.                                                                                                                               |
| Variant | A variant of a simulacrum or of a reality counterpart is considered as a narrower concept than one of those two elements. It is also used to define a set of elements in relation to a single element that is part of that set. I.e. "man and woman" is a variant of "woman", "golden apple" is a variant of "apple". |
