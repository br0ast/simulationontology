| Source  | This class represents the source of a simulation. It is intended as the entity that acknowledges a simulation as a legitimate symbolic relationship. A source can either be a dictionary of symbols or a knowledge graph in which symbolic information are present.                                                                                                                              |
| Variant | A variant of a simulacrum or of a reality counterpart is considered as a narrower concept than one of those two elements. It is also used to define a set of elements in relation to a single element that is part of that set. I.e. "man and woman" is a variant of "woman", "golden apple" is a variant of "apple". |
