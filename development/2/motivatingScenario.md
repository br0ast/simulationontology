# Motivating Scenario #1

***

## Name

Sources and variants

## Description

The domain of symbols is subjective, different sources might have different views on the elements that are inside a simulation. For this reason, the simulation itself is linked to the source that supports its existence. A source is not to be confused with the context. The context is the domain in which the simulation exists, the source is the medium in which the existance of that simulation is supported. For example, in the Bible it is written that the cross is the symbol of Jesus in a Christian context, the bible is the source of the simulation, its context is Christian. Simulacra and reality counterparts can have variants, and those variants can belong to different simulations compared to the original simulacra/realitycounterparts.


## Example

### Identifier

E2

### Content

In `dictionaryOfSymbols1` it is written that an `ashTree`, in a `norse` context, is the symbol of `odin`. In a `celtic` context it is the symbol of `connection` and `surrender`.

According to the same dictionary, an `olive`, in a `generalOrUnknown` context, is the symbol of `immortality`.

According to `dictionaryOfSymbols2`, an `olive`, in a `generalOrUnknown` context, is the symbol of `fertility`

In the same dictionary it is written that a `rose`, in `flowerLanguage` context, is the symbol of `love` and `beauty`. The `damaskRose`, a variant of `rose`, in `flowerRanguage`, is the symbol of `freshness`.

According to `literarySource1`, a `giant` is a symbol of `manBeforeTheFall` in a `generalOrUnknown` context.

According to the same source, `man`, of which `manBeforeTheFall` is a varian, in a `generalOrUnknown` context, is the symbol of `fire`.

In summary:

There exist the following simulations:

* `ashTree-odin`
* `ashTree-connection`
* `ashTree-surrender`
* `olive-immortality`
* `olive-fertility`
* `rose-love`
* `rose-beauty`
* `damaskRose-freshness`
* `man-fire`
* `giant-manBeforeTheFall`

There exist the following sources:

* `dictionaryOfSymbols1`
* `dictionaryOfSymbols2`
* `literarySource1`
