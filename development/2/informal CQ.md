## Question 2

### Identifier

CQ2.2

#### Based on

E2

## Question 6

### Identifier

CQ2.6

### General Question

Retrieve all the simulations without a source.

### Example Applied Question

Retrieve all the simulations without a source.

#### Expected Outcome

Nothing, as there should not be simulations without a source.

#### Results

None
