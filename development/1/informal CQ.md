## Question 6

### Identifier

CQ1.6

### General Question

Retrieve all the reality counterparts belonging to simulations that have a specific simulacrum along with the context of the simulation.

### Example Applied Question

Retrieve all the reality counterparts that have `ashTree` as a simulacrum along with the context of the simulation that links these two elements.

#### Expected Outcome

A table with reality counterparts and the contexts in which they appear in a simulations that have `ashTree` as a Simulacrum.

#### Results

| Reality Counterpart  | Context          |
