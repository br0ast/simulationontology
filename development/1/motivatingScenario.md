## Name

Simulations and Symbols

## Description

According to Baudrillard's Simulation and Simulacra theory, we do not perceive the real world. We live in the world of Simulations. A simulation is the relationship that links a symbol (simulacrum in Baudrillard's terms) to it's symbolic meaning (reality counterpart in Baudrillard's terms). The foundaments of his theory will be used in this ontology to conceptualize symbolic meanings. A simulation can also have a context in which it exists (Italian Context, Hebraic Context, Tarot Context, Flower Language...). Simulations that have more than one simulacrum do not exist.

### Content

An `ashTree`, in a `norse` context, is the symbol of `odin`. In a `celtic` context it is the symbol of `connection` and `surrender`.
`Odin`, in a `norse` context, is a symbol of `violence`
An `olive`, in a `generalOrUnknown` context, is the symbol of `fertility`.
A `rose`, in `flowerLanguage` context, is the symbol of `love` and `beauty`.
A `gazelle` is also a symbol of `beauty` in a `generalOrUnknown` context

In summary, there exist the following simulations:

* `ashTree-odin`
* `ashTree-connection`
* `ashTree-surrender`
* `olive-fertility`
* `rose-love`
* `rose-beauty`
* `odin-violence`
* `gazzelle-beauty`
