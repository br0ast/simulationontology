| Simulation          | A simulation is the symbolic relationship that happens between a symbol and its symbolic meaning. The term is taken from Baudrillard's "Simulation and Simulacra" philosophical theory.                                                    |
| Simulacrum          | A simulacrum is something that carries a secondary meaning (the first being its literal meaning), of symbolic nature. i.e. a skull is the set of bones of a head (literal meaning), but it is also the symbol of death (secondary, symbolic meaning) |
| Reality Counterpart | A reality counterpart is the symbolic meaning associated to a simulacrum. It's the element that is symbolically referred by the simulacrum in a simulation.                                                                                |
| Context             | The context is the setting (either social, historical, cultural etc...) in which a Simulation exists.  An ash tree, in the Norse context is a symbol of Odin. On the other hand, this tree in a Celtic context is a symbol of connection.  |
